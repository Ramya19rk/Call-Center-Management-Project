# Call Center Management Project

# Overview
This project aims to address challenges faced by call centers through data analysis, forecasting, and strategic decision-making. By leveraging historical data and employing various analytical techniques, we seek to optimize call center operations, improve agent performance, and enhance customer satisfaction.

# Data Import and Preprocessing
## Data Import: 
The project begins with importing an Excel file into a Jupyter Notebook for analysis.

## Data Cleaning: 
Null values are handled, and data cleaning techniques are applied to ensure data quality and integrity.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
The dataset is explored to understand its characteristics, identify patterns, and gain insights into key metrics and variables.

# Report Preparation and Forecasting Objectives
## Report Preparation: 
Various forecasting objectives are defined, including predicting call volume, estimating lead conversion rates, forecasting agent efficiency metrics, and optimizing resource allocation.

## Forecasting Techniques: 
Techniques such as machine learning models, time series analysis, and statistical methods are utilized to forecast key performance indicators and inform decision-making.

# Data Visualization Using Tableau
## Dashboard Creation: 
Tableau is used to create interactive dashboards for visualizing key metrics and trends.
## Visualization Examples: 
Various charts and graphs are generated, including bar charts for Agent Wise Attempt Number, donut charts for Call Status Wise Duration, tree maps for ID Details, and more.

# Conclusion
This project provides actionable insights and solutions to address the challenges faced by call centers. By leveraging data-driven approaches, call centers can optimize operations, improve agent performance, and enhance customer satisfaction.
